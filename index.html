                    <h5 class="card-title">Induction Program</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">It is important to arrange an induction day prior to you starting to use the
                        gym. This is for your own safety, as misuse of equipment may not just leave you feeling
                        embarrassed but could result in injury. Every gym will offer an induction day.Induction days
                        vary from gym to gym, but should ideally include an initial 1-2-1 health and fitness
                        consultation. Your instructor should familiarise you with all gym equipment. Some provide
                        initial exercise programs and regular follow up consultations and reviews.A lot of people turn
                        up to their gym induction wearing their everyday clothes with no intention of breaking a sweat.

                        While this is okay - your instructor will take you around the complex and show you how
                        everything works - it’s a huge missed opportunity. Take your kit with you and give your
                        instructor a better idea of what you are capable of.

                        “Inductions are seen as a quick review of the gym, but I prefer to see them as a training
                        session, so dress as such. The inductee should be dressed in their gym kit and the trainer
                        should use the opportunity to engage with the person [and assess] how good they are,” Leon
                        remarked.

                        You don’t have to go all out with brand new Ivy Park gear, but make sure you’re wearing
                        comfortable training attire (it’s perhaps best to leave the muscle vest at home for now!)</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title"> Facilities</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Facilities can vary greatly from gym to gym. Not just on a broad range of
                        cardiovascular equipment including:

                        Treadmills, Rowers, stationary bikes, cross trainers, versa climbers (step machines), steppers,
                        and rowing machines.

                        Resistance training equipment including:

                        Fixed weight machines, dumbbells, barbells and weight plates.

                        Also clean toilets, changing and shower rooms and exercise mats, stability balls and space to
                        exercise.

                        When choosing your gym you should check there is a number of the equipment you feel you will use
                        more. If you are going to focus on free weight training (dumbbells etc) check they have multiple
                        sets. On weight machines check they have setting from minimal weight to maximum weight to suit
                        your capabilities. Also check have they been maintained and in good condition. If you are going
                        to mainly use of cardio machines again check they have been well maintained, check they have
                        adequate number of machines compared to gym members.

                        Larger gyms also may have studio classes, sports and injury therapy. Sports shop, juice bars,
                        cafe and restaurant. Swimming pool, sauna, Jacuzzi, steam rooms. Tennis, squash and badminton
                        courts. Some gyms also offer child care facilities..</p>

A trainer will assess how your body works and make changes accordingly in order to help you reach your fitness goal(s) while keeping you healthy and safe while doing so..</p>

                        Gyms have a main work out area which tends to be divided into a free weights section including
                        dumbbells, bar bells. They may also have exercise machines with free weights or more commonly
                        exercise machines will have their own section.

                        Cardiovascular

                        The Cardiovascular area with have machines including treadmills (running machines), rowing
                        machines, exercise bikes (stationary).

                        Classes

                        Classes are group sessions and separate room from the cardio and free weights. Examples of group
                        class exercise include aerobics, Spin (cycling on a stationary bike), boxercise, high intensity
                        training (HIT) and yoga..</p>

                        such classes as Yoga [which has many proven benefits], Pilates [also known to benefit those with
                        back problems], or those that help build endurance.
                        Shower and locker facilities:

                        A must-have for those who want to work out but don’t feel comfortable working out in their
                        street clothes and athletes/trainers who need to change before using the equipment..</p>

You can bring along up to 2 guests per day, and each of them will be required to provide ID, so they know who is using the free pass with proof that the person is allowed access.

                        Please note that these items are not guaranteed at all times by any means; some places may have certain amenities only available at certain times of the day. Please ask about anything you want to know more about upon your visit by contacting the gym ahead of time
                        
                        After all, this is your first impression of them, and you don’t want to walk in only to find out that their fitness center doesn’t offer the things that are important to you..</p>
